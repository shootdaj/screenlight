# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-31)

**Core value:** Instant, gesture-controlled light that works from lock screen — no fumbling with UI in the dark.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Project Setup & CI/CD

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Project Setup & CI/CD)
Plan: Ready to plan (no plans created yet)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-01-31 — Roadmap created

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: - min
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: None yet

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- None yet — initial roadmap defines foundation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Research Flags for Future Phases:**
- Phase 3: Custom gesture algorithms for tilt-to-brightness mapping need user testing (start with ±45° = 0-100%, adjust based on UX)
- Phase 3: Volume button conflicts with "Select to Speak" accessibility (Google bug Jan 2026) — make gestures optional in settings
- Phase 4: Doze mode suspends sensors during idle — design for intermittent operation, educate users shake works best during active use

**Critical Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Phase 2: Wake lock management must unregister in onPause() not onDestroy() (battery drain + March 2026 Google Play enforcement)
- Phase 2: Foreground service type "specialUse" must be declared in manifest upfront (Android 14+ crashes without it)
- Phase 2: OLED burn-in prevention needed (immersive mode, pixel shifting, auto-timeout warning)
- Phase 3: Sensor listeners must unregister in onPause() (memory leaks compound after rotations)
- Phase 4: Lock screen security constraints (setShowWhenLocked() only, no keyguard dismissal)

## Session Continuity
